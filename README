Simple examples of how to render 3D surfaces and volumes defined with
implicit functions through GLSL.

Functions(w/ optional gradients), materials and the actual rendering algorithm
are split into different files loaded at run-time. If a gradient in symbolic form
is not available an approximate gradient is computed using finite differences.

Originally developed with versions of OpenGL < 3.x and tested on NVIDIA only.
